Set up the realgame [repo](https://github.com/ArcadeCity/realgame) and staging server, deployed initial BabylonJS grid animation to staging server at https://play.arcade.city. (three [pomodoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique))

Added [Inspiration](https://github.com/ArcadeCity/docs/wiki/Inspiration) page to the wiki and created custom sidebar nav.

Created first work log - this one!

Researched voxel usage in BabylonJS, found and played around with [Cryptovoxels](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/38281-cryptovoxels-an-ethereum-based-virtual-world/), watched a roundtable [chat](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/387351320) of VR developers.
